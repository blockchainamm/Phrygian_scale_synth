# Phrygian scale synthesizer

This python script emulates a Phrygian scale synthesizer based on the given notes stored in a list

The following are the sequence of frequencies (in Hertz) played as a pyrygian scale for each of the notes in order 'C4', 'G4','F4' :

The frequencies in Hz of ascending notes for C4 in the phrygian scale\
261.6256\
277.1826\
311.127\
349.2282\
391.9954\
415.3047\
466.1638\
523.2511

The frequencies in Hz of descending notes for C4 in the phrygian scale\
523.2511\
466.1638\
415.3047\
391.9954\
